## How to Use

    Open Base Folder:
    Open the folder in VS Code where you want the directory structure to be created.

    Create a Text File:
    Inside the base folder, create a plain text file with any name (e.g., structure.txt).

    Paste Directory Structure:
    Paste your tree structure inside the file. You don't even need to save it just paste your structure. For example:

    my-project/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style/
    │   └── main.css
    └── scripts/
        ├── app.js
        └── utils.js

    Run the Extension:

        Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

        Search for and run 'AI DiskTree Creator (AI Scaffold Builder)':
        
        Generate from Tree File.

    Done!
    The extension will parse the tree and create corresponding folders and blank files.

## Supported Syntax

    Indentation using pipes and dashes (├──, └──, etc.).

    Nesting via spacing or indentation (based on consistent tree formatting).

    Optional support for tree roots ending with / to indicate folders.

## Notes

    Existing files/folders with the same name will not be overwritten.

    Only plain-text structures are supported (no JSON or YAML for now).

    Make sure your tree format is clean and consistent.
